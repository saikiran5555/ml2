    "Regularization in Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is a set of techniques used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's objective function. The goal is to discourage the model from becoming too complex and fitting the training data too closely, thereby improving its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective Function:\n",
    "In machine learning, the objective function (also known as the loss function) represents the measure of how well the model is performing. Regularization modifies this function by adding a penalty term based on the complexity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Regularization Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization (Lasso):\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalty Term: Absolute values of the model parameters.\n",
    "Effect: Encourages sparsity in the model by driving some of the coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "Use Case: Feature selection, as it tends to produce sparse models by setting some feature weights to zero.\n",
    "L2 Regularization (Ridge):\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalty Term: Squared values of the model parameters.\n",
    "Effect: Penalizes large coefficients, making all of them relatively small.\n",
    "Use Case: Prevents overly large weight values, promoting a more evenly distributed impact of all features.\n",
    "Elastic Net Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Combination of L1 and L2: A linear combination of both L1 and L2 penalty terms.\n",
    "Effect: Combines the sparsity-inducing property of L1 with the regularization capabilities of L2.\n",
    "Use Case: Useful when there are multiple correlated features.\n",
    "Dropout (Neural Networks):\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect: During training, randomly \"drops out\" some neurons by setting their outputs to zero.\n",
    "Use Case: Reduces interdependence among neurons, preventing co-adaptation and overfitting in neural networks.\n",
    "Early Stopping:\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect: Monitors the model's performance on a validation set during training and stops training when performance starts to degrade.\n",
    "Use Case: Prevents overfitting by avoiding unnecessary training iterations that might lead to memorization of the training set.\n",
    "Batch Normalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect: Normalizes the inputs to a layer in a neural network, making the training more stable and preventing overfitting.\n",
    "Use Case: Helps mitigate the internal covariate shift problem and accelerates training.\n",
    "Weight Decay:\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect: Adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of the squared model parameters.\n",
    "Use Case: Encourages smaller weights, preventing the model from fitting the training data too closely.\n",
    "How Regularization Prevents Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization methods add a penalty for complexity to the objective function.\n",
    "By penalizing overly complex models, regularization discourages the model from fitting the noise in the training data.\n",
    "This results in a more generalized model that performs well on new, unseen data.\n",
    "Choosing the Strength of Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of regularization (the weight of the penalty term) is a hyperparameter.\n",
    "Cross-validation or other model selection techniques are used to find the optimal level of regularization for a given task."
