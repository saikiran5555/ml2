    "Reducing overfitting is crucial to ensure that a machine learning model generalizes well to new, unseen data. Here are several techniques to mitigate overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data. This helps identify if the model is overfitting and guides adjustments.\n",
    "Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization to penalize complex models. These techniques add penalty terms to the loss function, discouraging the model from learning overly intricate patterns from the training data.\n",
    "More Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the size of the training dataset can provide the model with a more diverse set of examples, helping it generalize better and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose relevant features and discard irrelevant or redundant ones. Feature selection reduces the complexity of the model and focuses on the most informative features.\n",
    "Simpler Model Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use simpler model architectures or reduce the number of layers and nodes in neural networks. A less complex model is less likely to memorize noise in the training data.\n",
    "Early Stopping:\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training. Stop training when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing the model from overfitting the training data excessively.\n",
    "Ensemble Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting. These methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "Dropout (Neural Networks):\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply dropout regularization in neural networks. Dropout randomly \"drops out\" some neurons during training, preventing the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons and improving generalization.\n",
    "Data Augmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Augment the training data by creating variations of existing examples (e.g., rotating images, adding noise). This expands the diversity of the dataset and helps the model generalize better.\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjust hyperparameters, such as learning rate or batch size, to find a balance between model complexity and generalization. Use techniques like grid search or random search for effective hyperparameter tuning."
