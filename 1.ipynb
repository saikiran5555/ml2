    "Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the data instead of the underlying patterns. As a result, the model performs well on the training set but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "Consequences: The overfitted model is overly complex and fails to generalize to new data. It may memorize the training set, including its outliers or noise, leading to poor performance on real-world tasks.\n",
    "Mitigation:\n",
    "Use more training data to provide a diverse set of examples.\n",
    "Simplify the model by reducing its complexity (e.g., decrease the number of features, use regularization).\n",
    "Apply techniques like cross-validation to assess model performance on different subsets of the data.\n",
    "Underfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the training data. The model fails to learn the relationships and performs poorly on both the training set and new data.\n",
    "Consequences: The underfitted model lacks the capacity to represent the complexity of the data, leading to inaccurate predictions and low performance.\n",
    "Mitigation:\n",
    "Use a more complex model that can better capture the relationships in the data.\n",
    "Increase the number of features or use more sophisticated algorithms.\n",
    "Ensure that the model is trained for an adequate number of iterations (epochs).\n",
    "Mitigating Overfitting and Underfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, penalize overly complex models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This encourages the model to generalize better.\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation helps assess a model's performance on different subsets of the data. It can reveal whether a model is overfitting or underfitting and guide adjustments.\n",
    "More Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the size of the training dataset can provide the model with a more diverse set of examples, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose relevant features and discard irrelevant or redundant ones. This helps reduce the complexity of the model and mitigates overfitting.\n",
    "Ensemble Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods, like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, combine multiple models to improve overall performance and mitigate the risk of overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "Early Stopping:\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop training when the performance stops improving. This prevents overfitting by avoiding unnecessary training iterations.\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjust the hyperparameters of the model, such as learning rate or the number of layers in a neural network, to find a balance between complexity and performance."
